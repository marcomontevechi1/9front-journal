I started this journal as a way to keep track of my distributed operational systems explorations.
I don't expect to go far with this.

When all is done, I expect to donate the small processing power of my nodes to [the BOINC project](https://boinc.berkeley.edu) or something similar. Anything not involving A.I. research.
